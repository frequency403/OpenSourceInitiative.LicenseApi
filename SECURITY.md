# Security Policy

We take the security of this project seriously. Thank you for responsibly disclosing vulnerabilities.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
- Please DO NOT open public issues for suspected security problems.
- Instead, email: **frequency403@gmail.com**
- Include as much detail as possible: affected versions, environment, PoC/reproduction steps, and potential impact.

We aim to acknowledge reports within 3 business days and provide a remediation plan or status update within 10 business days.

## Supported versions
Security fixes are provided for the latest released version. Backports to prior versions may be made at the maintainer’s discretion when the fix is low risk.

## Coordinated disclosure
If a vulnerability is confirmed, we appreciate working with you on coordinated disclosure. We’re happy to credit reporters in release notes unless you prefer to remain anonymous.
